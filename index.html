            <p>Pi Swap is an innovative protocol that offers users a convenient way to purchase tokens and NFTs on
                popular EVM chains like BSC, Polygon and Ethereum using Pi coin. As the protocol approaches its mainnet
                launch, it seeks to leverage the strong community of Pi users. This is made possible through a custom
                backend for the Pi application and a smart contract for the EVM side. The Pi Swap protocol promises to
                revolutionize the way users engage with cryptocurrency by creating a seamless platform for purchasing
                tokens and NFTs. With Pi coin, users can now easily access a wide range of blockchain assets without the
